## sink-poset
generates a poset of reachable states for chip-firing on a graph with sink

## star-fre-poset-cndnsd
a more user-friendly version of star-firing-poset

## star-firing-poset
the full code Annika wrote for labeled chip-firing on the k-branched star/k-path graph (hard to use if you're not Annika but useful for debugging)
can give you lots of info about reachable states, the number of paths to a terminal state, probability of reaching a certain state... etc

## unwalled-poset
generates a poset of reachable states for labeled chip-firing on ZZ

## walled-poset-booleans
generates only the boolean sublattices from walled-poset

## walled-poset
generates a poset of reachable states for labeled chip-firing on NN
